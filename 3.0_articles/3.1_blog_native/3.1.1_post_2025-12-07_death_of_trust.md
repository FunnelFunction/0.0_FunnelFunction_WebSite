## Summary

This post argues that "trust" is marketing's greatest computational weakness—a black box invoked when attribution fails. It introduces f(Commitment) as the mathematically rigorous replacement.

## Core Argument

> "Trust is what we call it when we don't know why they bought."
> — Funnel Function Institute, 2025

Trust fails four tests:
1. **Circularity** - Defined by its outcomes, not inputs
2. **Unmeasurability** - No agreed units or protocol
3. **Anachronism** - Pre-digital concept in digital world
4. **Non-Invertibility** - Cannot solve backward from target

---

## The Replacement: f(Commitment)

```
f(Commitment) = (σ × π × Ι) / (F + R + Status_Quo)
```

Where:
- **σ** = Somatic Certainty (Body)
- **π** = Prediction Confidence (Mind)
- **Ι** = Identity Congruence (Soul)
- **F** = Friction
- **R** = Residual Risk
- **Status_Quo** = Inertia

---

## Key Insight

Trust is not a cause—it's a **symptom**. It's the label applied after commitment threshold is crossed.

```
f(Trust) ≜ EMERGENT_LABEL(f(Commitment) > θ)
```
