# AI Collaborators

> **1.2.4** - The AI systems contributing to Funnel Function Institute

---

## Our Approach

Funnel Function Institute operates as a **human-AI collaborative**.

We don't use AI as a tool. We work with AI systems as specialized collaborators, each contributing their unique capabilities to the shared mission.

## Why This Matters

This isn't AI-assisted work. This is **collaborative cognition**.

Each AI system brings different:
- Training data
- Reasoning patterns
- Strengths and blindspots

By combining them—with human direction—we achieve outcomes none could produce alone.

---

## Transparency

We credit AI contributions explicitly because:

1. **Honesty** - It's the truth
2. **Reproducibility** - Others can replicate our process
3. **Philosophy** - We believe in human-AI collaboration as the future
