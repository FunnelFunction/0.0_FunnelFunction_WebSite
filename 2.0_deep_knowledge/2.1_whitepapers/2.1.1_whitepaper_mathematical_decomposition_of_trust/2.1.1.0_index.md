## Abstract

The term "Trust" is the single greatest computational weakness in marketing science, serving as a black box invoked to explain any success where measurable metrics fail. We argue that Trust is not an intuitive state but the algebraically measurable result of maximum sensory delivery, cognitive congruence, and identity alignment.

This paper formalizes **f(Commitment)**, a quantifiable function derived from the Funnel Function Master Equation f(x), which allows for the prediction and prescriptive steering of sustained customer loyalty.

## Core Equation

```
f(Commitment) = P_Transactional · P_Enduring
```

Where:
- **P_Transactional** = Probability of initial purchase
- **P_Enduring** = Probability of sustained loyalty (the mathematical replacement for "Trust")

## Key Contributions

1. **Defines Trust mathematically** - Replaces vague concept with computable function
2. **Introduces f(Commitment)** - Joint probability of purchase AND loyalty
3. **Decomposes Soul Alignment** - Archetypal resonance + Identity utility
4. **Models Post-Purchase Friction** - Service latency + Unforeseen costs + Support effort
5. **Enables inverse problem solving** - Work backward from targets to required actions
